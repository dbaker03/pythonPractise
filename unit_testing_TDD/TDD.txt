Test driven development

1. Write the test (it will fail)
2. Write the code needed to make it pass
3. Refactor your code
REPEAT

- You have a suite of tests
- You know your code works
- You code better
    - Think about inputs and outputs
    - It's lean - you're only doing what's needed
    - You deliver code that's testable
    - You break down the problem at hand into units
