# abstraction - take away detail, view from a higher level and make things easier
#   eg user doesn't need to worry about logic of maximum speed
#   we don't worry how .append() works we just know how to use it
#   same with toaster we don't know how it works we just use it

# encapsulation - hide away things
#   we hid away the speed because we protect it
#   In a toaster the user can choose exact current they use the knob to adjust heat

# inheritance - classes should be able to inherit each other
#   If we then want a 4 slice toaster we can inherit lots of compondents and designs from 2 slice

# polymorphism - classes should be able to contain each other and be in the same list where they have common parent
#   we can change methods and attributes from parent class - think override in C#, also multiple methods with different arguments (only C# - overload)

# Single responsibility each class does one thing
# Open closed - open for extension, closed for modification
# Liskov substitution - any instance of a parent class you should be able to sub in a subclass
# Interface segregation
# Dependency inversion

#think of own analgy
